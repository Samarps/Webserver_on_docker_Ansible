# Webserver_on_docker_Ansible

 I've created an Ansible Playbook which can Configure Webserver on a Docker Container, & also configures in between dependencies like configuring Docker, etc.

Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation.

## Task Description
ðŸ”° Write an Ansible PlayBook that does the following operations in the managed nodes:\
ðŸ”¹ Configure Docker\
ðŸ”¹ Start and enable Docker services\
ðŸ”¹ Pull the httpd server image from the Docker Hub\
ðŸ”¹ Run the docker container and expose it to the public\
ðŸ”¹ Copy the html code in /var/www/html directory and start the web server

Want to know how it works? Watch this video, were I explained & executed the code on my system:
