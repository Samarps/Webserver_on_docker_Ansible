# Webserver_on_docker_Ansible

 I've created an Ansible Playbook which can Configure Webserver on a Docker Container, & also configures in between dependencies like configuring Docker, etc.

Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation. This Task was given by Sir Vimal Daga in the Arth training recently.

▪️ ARTH Task-10
🔰 Write an Ansible PlayBook that does the following operations in the managed nodes:
🔹 Configure Docker
🔹 Start and enable Docker services
🔹 Pull the httpd server image from the Docker Hub
🔹 Run the docker container and expose it to the public
🔹 Copy the html code in /var/www/html directory and start the web server

Hope you guys liked it and learned something new. Thankyou, I'll meet you in the next one.
